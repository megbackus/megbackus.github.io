<h2>THE 4TH FLOOR</h2>
The 4th floor is a public laboratory and educational facility with a focus on information, design, technology, and the applied arts. The more than 12,000 square foot space hosts equipment, expertise, programs, events, and meetings with an aim to facilitate learning through doing.

<!--Curious about the target scope of a space like the 4th floor. A typical hackerspace has 20-50 members (Emerging Hackerspaces – Peer-production Generation, Jarkko Moilanen, 2012, http://blog.ossoil.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/0ss2012-moilanen.pdf). We need hundreds, if not thousands, finding value in our space. Questions I have: What are the barriers to participation in a typical hackerspace (is it skills, interest, money, or what?) What range of activities does our library hackerspace need to offer in order to appeal to enough people? How many is enough--70+% of the population reads books each year. Add movies and magazines, and traditional library resources target almost everyone. But a makerspace is different--not everyone has figured out that making things is a worthwhile and rewarding thing to do. But we’re trusting that there’s a massive cultural shift towards making underway, so what is the smartest tactic for making that shift as inclusive as possible? Should we try to have a more representative sample of equipment--not just digital production but looms, pottery wheels, stovetops, gardens--the way we try to represent all interests in our traditional materials, or should we really evangelize and support learning and use of hardware and software? What economic barriers do we need to take seriously as we proceed? Unlike reading and returning a book or movie, making things often consumes stuff--excludable, rivalrous, non-public goods--and that stuff often requires money. What kind of model can generate abundance, enough for everyone? Or do we just accept that economic barriers are not ours to overcome: while we’ll have as much shareable equipment as possible, people will find the type of making they can afford.-->

<H2>LIBRARIES AS SOCIAL SCULPTURE</H2>
I took my SU class on field trips to work with 3D printers & hackerspaces, arguing the fit with public libraries. Worked with a student (the excellent Lauren Britton-Smedley) to get a library to adopt the idea & be the 1st known public library with a Makerbot.

<h2>ACE THE LIBRARY DOG</h2>
Not a reading dog, not exclusively anyway. This live dog was available for checkout to use for self-directed library learning. He can listen to you read, sure, but he can also teach behavior science, animal care, fetch….
